I liked the idea of a helpful page for JMU KIN students. 

2.
I think mine has a better user experience because the css and all the style is not working for the site. It is working for the other
review I am doing so I am confused why it is not showing up. For me it is all just text and the images are not loading either. I think
our codebases are very similar and would both be maintainable.

3.
The code is well-structured within files and it is organized in the directories with an images directory holding all the images
and a css directory holding all the css files.

4.
The only issue I found is that the css and images are not working/loading with the html. 

5.
I do not have any other constructive comments for the project besides update the code so the css and images work.
